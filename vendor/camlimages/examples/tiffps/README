Tiffps is a filter from a tiff (and jpeg) file to postscript.

Usage:
	tiffps infile

	infile must be a tiff (or jpeg), and the program outputs
	a postscript file to the standard output.

Command line options:
	There are many options. Try tiffps -help to print
	help message. I hope it explains enough.

Note:		
	Do not try tiffps for jpeg files. It works, but the result is
	in Postscript level 1 (without compression). For jpeg files
	you should use jpeg2ps, a wrapper for Postscript level 2
	found at:

		http://www.pdflib.com/jpeg2ps/index.html

	This is much smaller and faster.
