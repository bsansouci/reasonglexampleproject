4.2.3
	- compilation fix for homebrew
	- compilation fix when there is no supported subpackages which
	  require external libraries

4.2.2
        * Added some documents to mli files
	* Fixed memory leaks in ftintf.c. Thanks to Max Mouratov!   
        * Fixed warning switches for OCaml 4.03.0
        * .cmx files are now installed

4.2.1
        * Load_only_the_first_frame load_option is added
        * Fixes for 4.02.2 new warnings
 
4.2.0
        * OCaml 4.02.0 string/bytes fix

4.1.2
        * GIF lib version 5 support
        * clang related compilation fixes

4.1.1
        * omake --config clean up
        * pkg-config is now used if exists in order to seek external libraries

4.1.0
        * bmp was not linked with examples. Since bmp is pure ML libarary, 
          you may need to add -linkall to linker command to your build script,
          otherwise the module is silently ignored. 
        * bmp 32bit RGBA is now supported
        * added jpeg marker load/saving (not tested well)
        * added exif support (you need libexif)
        ! refactored ocamlfind package names (probably introduce some incompatibility)
        * removed unused old configure and make scripts
        * Applied GODI's patches. Now omake takes the following variable definitions:
             - INCLUDES
             - LDFLAGS
             - NATIVE_ENABLED
             - ARG_WANT_XXX
             - ARG_PATH_GS
             - ARG_FREETYPE_CONFIG
          If they are not defined, some default values are deduced.

4.0.2
	* ppm save was somehow disabled.

4.0.1
	* Minor bug fixes, patch submitted by Damien Doligez 
 
4.0.0
	* Stop supporting the autoconf build. (It might works though.)
	* Instead of autoconf, using omake and ocamlfind
	* Subpackages: no need to link codes for uninterested format.
	* Stop supporting lablgtk1
	  - Ximage2 module is now Ximage, and the older Ximage is removed
	  - OXimage2 module is now OXimage, and the older OXimage is removed

        * Small bug fix for image load memory allocation vulnerability

3.0.2
        * O'Caml 3.11 port.
	* Integer overflow vulnerability fix for pngread.c

        * Alpha channel support for png images.

3.0.0
        * new version numbering scheme
        * autoconf and makefiles cleanup
        * fix examples compilation

2.2.1
        * Now compiling with -warn-error -A
2.2
        * complete code review and rewriting
        * the main module, originally named "Image" is now "Images".
        * the whole set of compiled files are now installed in the library
        * a new export for the Ps module:

          returns the bounding box option of a postscript file image.

2.01
        * bug fix at load_Glyph at freetype1/ftintf.c
2.00
        * O'Caml 3.03 dll support. (This and later versions of camlimages
          will not  work with the older O'Camls).
        * Better support for giflib library
1.03
        * Image.save takes the image format now as an option.
1.02
        * added CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow and blacK) color space 
          (even though we have no trivial good color conversion 
          between CMYK and RGB)
        * added RGBA (RGB with the Alpha channel) and CMYK images
        * Colorhist
        * Unit
