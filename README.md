# ReasonglExampleProject

Example project using `ReasonGL`.

This shows how to draw a rectangle using `ReasonGL`, which gets compiled to WebGL calls or OpenGL calls thanks to `rebel` the build system.

This is a great starter project for anyone wanting to use `ReasonGL`.

A bigger example is [ReWitness](http://github.com/bsansouci/rewitness).
