# ReasonGL Full Example
Complex Example project using `ReasonGL`.

To see a simple example look at [this branch](https://github.com/bsansouci/reasonglexampleproject/tree/bsb-support-new).


This project is showing how to:
- render text, textures and arbitrary geometry in GL
- handle mouse / keyboard events
- layout and draw arbitrarily complex view hierarchies using [Relayout](https://github.com/jordwalke/ReLayout)
- compile to js and native

This is setup like a game engine where as much of the data is loaded / generated at load time, and very little is done in the render loop. 

## Install

To install run `npm install`.

## Build

To build to js, run `npm run build` and to start `npm run start`. That'll spawn a simple python static server, then go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

To build to bytecode, run `npm run build:bytecode` and to start `npm run start:bytecode`. This uses `ocamlc` which compiles to a bytecode representation ran in the ocaml VM.

To build to native, run `npm run build:native` and to start `npm run start:native`.
Native should be about 10x faster than bytecode at the expense of compilation speed.

## Random notes

Everything needed is vendor-ed inside the repo so we don't depend on opam. We're using the C library freetype to parse the font file in native/bytecode version and using opentype.js for the web version.

There's a full version of Relayout checked in the repo, as well as freetype and a patched version of camlimages
